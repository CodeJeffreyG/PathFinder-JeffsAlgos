#Jeff's Graph Algorithms

About The Project

I was inspired to create this project while researching data structures and algorithms I thought it would be a useful for the learning process, not only for me but others interested in the subject.

The goal of this project is to be able to let the user select multiple algorithms. Such as breadth-first search or depth-first search. The user can also choose a start point and an end point of two nodes for the algorithm to traverse through.

Once the search begins, the user can see how the chosen algorithm gets from its starting to its ending destination.

#my thought process

The first step was creating a grid with nested loopsâ€”fifteen rows with 50 columns.

I iterated through each node, and each node created a node component for a total of 100 Node components. Each one has a unique key of the index in which the node was created.
